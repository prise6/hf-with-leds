# led strip type
# We are using BiblioPixel to control led strips
# supported are APA102, LPD8806, and WS2801 led strips for SPI control
# For SERIAL and MATRIX you can also use the following
# WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, NEOPIXEL, APA104, WS2811_400, TM1809, TM1804
# TM1803, UCS1903, SM16716, LPD1886, P9813

# This describes how to use the leds with the gpios 
# MIRROR - same number of fft channels on the led strip and gpios. mirrored operation

# LEDONLY - any number of fft channels based on led_channel_count

# all color map values vary brightness by intensity

# sACN E1.31 setup
# enable_multicast = True will broadcast data to all devices on the network subnet
# This is a simpler network configuration method since controllers do not need
# data access information. Channels can be mirrored on multiple controllers since
